# cat-gif-generator

This is just a python script that utilizes an API called The Cat API which is linked here: https://thecatapi.com/
It was actually my first time trying to use/implement an API into a program so I decided to just make it something extremely simple.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It takes the API key from The Cat API as well as the URL it is going to pull requests from.

I made a helper method getGif() which will return a cat gif.
The main method Main() utilizes getGif(), which will output "Here is a pretty kitty for you: "
The program will then open up a web browser displaying a random cat gif for the user to enjoy looking at!

Overall, I learned that utilizing API's is pretty simple. In the future I hope to create my own API.
Maybe for something I really enjoy like Pokemon. (Although I'm sure it's already been done. âœ„)
